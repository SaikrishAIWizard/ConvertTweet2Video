## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Python automation script capable of converting text tweets into engaging video content. The script will leverage social media data extraction techniques and video generation algorithms to transform textual content into visually appealing videos.

## Project Details
- **Skills**: Python, Automation Scripting, Social Media Data Extraction, Video Generation

## Project Description
I develop a script that can convert tweets into captivating video content. The script should be able to extract text from tweets and generate corresponding video clips where the text is visually presented, potentially accompanied by relevant images or animations.

### Test Prompt
As a test scenario, consider the following prompt:
"Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy."

The objective is to create a script that can convert this prompt into a tweet video where the text is being read aloud.
